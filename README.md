# Bruce Springsteen Song Reorderer

## Description
The Bruce Springsteen Song Reorderer (BSSR) allows a user to take lyrics from Bruce Springsteen songs and use these chosen lyrics as content for creating new works of art. The project implements React-Beautiful-DnD to allow for dragging and dropping of these lines allowing the user to assemble songs as they like. 

The writing process here is a form of Collage Poetry. It is similar to magnetic poetry, Exquisite Corpse (a game for generating poetry text with contributions from multiple poets), and other poetic practices. Like magnetic poetry, it is meant to be a low-stakes way to be creative and hopefully to create appealing and interesting texts.

The app was created as my final solo project for Prime Digital Academy.
